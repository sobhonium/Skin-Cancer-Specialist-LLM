    "input": "",
    "output": "Collagens are the foundational component of diverse tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, and basement membranes, and are the most abundant protein class in animals. The fibrillar collagens are large, complex, multidomain proteins, all containing the characteristic triple helix motif. The most prevalent collagens are heterotrimeric, meaning that cells express at least two distinctive procollagen polypeptides that must assemble into specific heterotrimer compositions. The molecular mechanisms ensuring correct heterotrimeric assemblies are poorly understood - even for the most common collagen, type-I. The longstanding paradigm is that assembly is controlled entirely by the ~30 kDa globular C-propeptide (C-Pro) domain. Still, this dominating model for procollagen assembly has left many questions unanswered. Here, we show that the C-Pro paradigm is incomplete. In addition to the critical role of the C-Pro domain in templating assembly, we find that the amino acid sequence near the C terminus of procollagen's triple-helical domain plays an essential role in defining procollagen assembly outcomes. These sequences near the C terminus of the triple-helical domain encode conformationally stabilizing features that ensure only desirable C-Pro-mediated trimeric templates are committed to irreversible triple-helix folding. Incorrect C-Pro trimer assemblies avoid commitment to triple-helix formation thanks to destabilizing features in the amino acid sequences of their triple helix. Incorrect C-Pro assemblies are consequently able to dissociate and search for new binding partners. These findings provide a distinctive perspective on the mechanism of procollagen assembly, revealing the molecular basis by which incorrect homotrimer assemblies are avoided and setting the stage for a deeper understanding of the biogenesis of this ubiquitous protein."

New treatments are needed because the currently used drug, ivermectin, is contraindicated in pregnant women and those co-infected with Loa loa. The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID) produced, crystallized and determined the apo structure of N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged O. volvulus macrophage migration inhibitory factor-1 (His-OvMIF-1). OvMIF-1 is a possible drug target. His-OvMIF-1 has a unique jellyfish-like structure with a prototypical macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) trimer as the `head' and a unique C-terminal `tail'. Deleting the N-terminal tag reveals an OvMIF-1 structure with a larger cavity than that observed in human MIF that can be targeted for drug repurposing and discovery. Removal of the tag will be necessary to determine the actual biological oligomer of OvMIF-1 because size-exclusion chromatographic analysis of His-OvMIF-1 suggests a monomer, while PISA analysis suggests a hexamer stabilized by the unique C-terminal tails."

    "output": "Dab2 is an endocytic adaptor protein involved in various physiological processes and signaling pathways. Dab2 is deregulated in various cancers; however, its role in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we used the DMBA/TPA induced murine skin carcinogenesis model to examine the role of Dab2 in skin tumour progression. We generated tamoxifen inducible Dab2 conditional knockout system for our study. Loss of Dab2 led to delayed papilloma initiation and reduced papilloma burden. Delayed papilloma initiation was due to reduced proliferative potential of the papillomas due to Dab2 loss. Furthermore, while the WT papillomas progressed to SCC, the papillomas formed in Dab2 cKO mice failed to undergo malignant conversion to SCC. Dab2 cKO tumours showed reduced expression of K8, a marker for aggressive tumour. Moreover, Dab2 cKO tumours failed to undergo EMT as shown by reduced expression of Vimentin and Twist1. Dab2 cKO tumours also showed reduced expression of Sox2, a stem cell marker. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed upregulation of Dab2 expression in the human skin cancer cell lines as compared to normal human skin keratinocytes. In patients, TCGA data analysis of skin cancer melanoma (SKCM) showed a trend where high levels of Dab2 correlated with poor overall survival. The present study shows that Dab2 promotes tumour progression in skin SCC."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare aggressive intraocular tumour that spreads most commonly to the liver in tumours with loss of one copy of chromosome 3 (HR-M3); current treatments for metastatic disease remain largely ineffective. Pre-clinical research is increasingly using three-dimensional models that better recapitulate the tumour microenvironment (TME). One aspect of the TME is the acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) that influences cell proliferation, migration and response to therapy. Although commercial matrices are used in culture, the composition and biochemical properties may not be representative of the tumour ECM in vivo. This study identifies UM metastatic risk specific ECM proteins by developing methodology for decellularisation of low- and high- metastatic risk tissue samples (LR-D3 vs. HR-M3). Proteomic analysis revealed a matrisome signature of 34 core ECM and ECM-associated proteins upregulated in HR-M3 UM. Combining additional UM secretome and whole cell iTRAQ proteomic datasets revealed enriched GO and KEGG pathways including 'regulating ECM binding' and 'PI3K/Akt signalling'. Structural analyses of decellularised matrices revealed microarchitecture of differing fibre density and expression differences in collagen 4, collagen 6A1 and nidogen 1, between metastatic risk groups. This approach is a powerful tool for the generation of ECM matrices relevant to high metastatic risk UM."

Unlike other forms of OSCC, where the connection between HPV and cancer is less clear, HPV-HNSCC is characterized by HPV infection of stratified squamous epithelium in the throat, mouth, respiratory tract, and anogenital tract. HPV DNA is found in high amounts in saliva and gargle samples of patients with HPV-related HNSCC. The specificity of oral HPV DNA and mRNA detection in OPSCCs varies, and the higher transmission rates of HPV through vaginal-oral sexual activity may explain gender differences in HPV-positive HNSCC cases. Racial disparities in gene expression also contribute to differing disease progression in Black and White patients. CD8+ T cell increases and P16 activation in the cancer microenvironment are associated with better survival in OSCC. Fusobacterium levels are elevated in OSCC patients, with significant reductions in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. These microbiota changes are linked to HPV-associated HNSCC and may serve as biomarkers for further research into the role of the oral microbiota in the disease."

Biological testing showed that these nanomaterials were cytotoxic to the melanoma A375 cell line but did not harm normal L929 cells. Apoptosis assays indicated significant cell death in A375 cells, accompanied by an increase in pro-apoptotic gene expression (P53 and Bax) and a decrease in anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2.
